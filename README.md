# ZK-Swap

ZK-Swap is an open-source NFT AMM protocol on StarkNet developed in Cairo. Its modular architecture and customizable pool configuration enable other projects building on top of it – with the overall goal of increasing NFT liquidity for the StarkNet ecosystem.

Instead of trading NFTs on marketplaces with centralized order books, users can buy NFTs from and sell NFTs into on-chain liquidity pools. The asset prices are calculated and adjusted automatically based on the individually defined price functions providing higher NFT liquidity.

This repository is structured in two main parts: first the underlying smart contracts for different pool types and bonding curves and second a generic marketplace frontend as interface to the contracts.
