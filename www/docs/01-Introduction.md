# Introduction

## What is ZK-Swap?

ZK-Swap is an automated market maker (AMM) for trading Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) in a decentralized manner on StarkNet.
Instead of trading NFTs on marketplaces with centralized order books, users can buy NFTs from and sell NFTs into on-chain liquidity pools.
The asset prices are calculated and adjusted automatically based on the underlying bonding curve aka price function, increasing NFT liquidity.
The goal is to provide the highest possible degree of configurability on the protocol level.
