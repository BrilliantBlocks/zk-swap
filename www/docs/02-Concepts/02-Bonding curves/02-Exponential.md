With an exponential bonding curve the price of an asset increases or decreases by a percentage (delta) every time the asset supply changes (NFTs are bought from or sold into the pool).

Let $N_{tokens}$ denote the amount of NFTs inside the pool. The price for the next asset to buy or sell is calculated with the following formula:
$$
\text{NextPrice} = \text{CurrentPrice} (1 \pm \delta)^{N_{tokens}}
$$
