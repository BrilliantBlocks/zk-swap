Choosing a buy pool lets NFT owners sell assets of specified collections in exchange for ERC-20 tokens.
The supported collections to be bought are specified by the buy pool owner himself.
Buy pools can be either configured as constant, linear or exponential and with increasing or decreasing price changes.
