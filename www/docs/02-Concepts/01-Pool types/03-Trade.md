Choosing a trade pool lets NFT owners and collectors both buy from and sell assets into the pool in exchange for ERC-20 tokens.
The NFTs to be sold and the supported collections to be bought are added to the pool by the trade owner himself.
Buy pools can be either configured as constant, linear or exponential and with increasing or decreasing price changes in both directions.
