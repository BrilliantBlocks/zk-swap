# Introduction

## What is zk-Swap?

The zk-Swap project is an automated market maker (AMM) for trading Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) in a decentralized manner on StarkNet.
It supports various types of NFT trading using liquidity pools.
The goal is to provide a high degree of configurability such that many other projects of varying domains may benefit.
